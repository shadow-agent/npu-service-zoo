He was 69. \n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\" \n\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \"Thief.\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \"Miami Vice\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \"Crime Story\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \n\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \"Midnight Run\" (1988), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Snatch\" (2000). \n\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \"Law & Order\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \"Trial by Jury.\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \n\nFarina was on \"Law & Order\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L.

He checked the weather forecast. A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. \"Do you know where the flashlights are?\" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. \n\n\"Get up, get up, R.J.! \" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. \n\n\"I've lost him,\" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. \n\nAfter a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. \n\nAt the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. \"I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. \" \n\nR.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground.
