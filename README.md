# Benchmark FuriosaAI RNGD Across Multiple LLM Tasks

This project benchmarks the performance of FuriosaAI RNGD for a range of LLM tasks, including:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot: Use databases and QA datasets to test retrieval accuracy and generative capabilities.
- Translation: Evaluate multi-language translation accuracy and performance.
- Summarization: Test the summarization of large-scale documents.
- Multi-Modal Agent: Combine vision models and LLMs for multi-modal understanding and reasoning.

The project enables easy comparisons between GPU and NPU environments using unified APIs and configurable pipelines.
